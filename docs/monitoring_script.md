## üõ†Ô∏è `monitor_log_counter.sh`

This Bash script is designed to ensure the `log_monitor.py` script is always running. It is intended to be scheduled via `cron` to run periodically (e.g., every minute), acting as a lightweight watchdog process.

### üìÅ Script Location

`/var/ossec/integrations/monitor_log_counter.sh`

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Functionality

* Checks whether the `log_monitor.py` script is running.
* If not, logs the incident and starts it using the specified Python interpreter.
* Redirects stdout and stderr of the Python script to the same log file.

### üïí Example Crontab Entry

To run this watchdog every minute:

```bash
* * * * * /var/ossec/integrations/monitor_log_counter.sh
```

### üìã Log Output Example

When the monitored script is not running:

```
2025/05/08 14:02:01 monitor_log_counter.sh: INFO - log_monitor.py not running. Starting...
```

---

### üìé Notes

* This script uses `pgrep -f` to search for the script in the process list.
* `grep -v $$` avoids matching itself in the process list.
* `nohup` ensures the script stays running even after the cron job exits.
